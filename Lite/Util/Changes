Revision history for Perl extension NetAddr::IP::Util

1.33  Tue Sep 21 17:50:50 PDT 2010
	Add UtilPolluted namespace to contain name space pollution
	created by "use Socket" when invoking Socket6.

1.32  Wed May 12 14:18:20 PDT 2010
	In Util.xs, 
	changed netswap() to postincrement 
        *a++ = to *a and added increment after save to mollify some
        picky compilers that return possible undefined behavior.

        changed type of _128x10 to 'void'

1.31  Tue Jun  9 10:31:11 PDT 2009
	ferret out shell value for Makefile.PL when calling
	./configure for systems where the 'x' bit gets lost
	due to bug in Archive::Tar

1.30  Sat Mar  7 16:35:33 PST 2009
	make the compiler test check the environment for
	CC before using Perl's default compiler

1.29  Sat Mar  7 16:15:18 PST 2009
	revised compiler test in Makefile.PL for Util v1.29
	to accomodate picky Solaris "cc"

1.28  Wed Dec 17 14:14:06 PST 2008
	set uninitialized "carry" in XS bin2bcd to zero

1.27  Tue Dec  9 12:00:08 PST 2008
	revised UtilPP v1.7 to work around perl 5.8.4 
	failures with certain @_ operations of goto &sub...
	see perl bug [ 23429]. Unfortunately, perl-5.8.4 is
	the distribution of choice for many solaris boxes

1.26  Fri Nov 28 23:19:01 PST 2008
	revised XS code to be full re-entrant... thread safe.
	removed all traces of mutex locks
	removed function 'threads' here an in UtilPP v1.6

1.25  Tue Nov 18 19:08:56 PST 2008
	correct documentation error in Util_PP v1.5

	add threads reporting to Util.xs and UtilPP

	added what is hopefully thread safe operation via
	serialization. Must be invoked by "--with-threads"

1.24  Wed Nov  5 18:13:20 PST 2008
	Clean up Makefile.PL to check actual required link
	libraries against the perl build for consistency

1.23  Sun Nov  2 10:10:38 PST 2008
	add missing headers in configure and localconf.h for Solaris inet_xton
	thanks to Karl Bunch <karl@digilink.net> for spotting the bug.

1.22  Wed Oct 22 14:54:12 PDT 2008
	eliminated dependence on PL_sawampersand
	thanks to Mark Martinec <Mark.Martinec@ijs.si>
	for spotting this and submitting a patch.

	force -noxs mode for Win32

	use autoconf to configure 'C' build

1.21  Thu Oct 16 19:35:33 PDT 2008
	again... clear build bug for Win32
	and lets get the version number right since it appears
	that it was up-rev'd at some point to 1.xx

0.20  Mon Oct  6 13:07:34 PDT 2008
	clear build bug for Win32

0.19  Sat Sep 27 13:36:58 PDT 2008
	updated test for ENDIANess in siteconf

	add test in inet_aton to detect overange IP dot quad values
	missed by some broken Socket implementations
	i.e. 256.1.1.1

0.18  Sun Aug  6 10:48:25 PDT 2006
	correct shiftleft documentation
	correct mask4to6 documentation

0.17  Thu Jul  6 10:46:48 PDT 2006
	update 'siteconf line 1608' to fix empty variable in inet_aton test
	update 'siteconf line 1636' to fix empty variable in inet_pton test
	add missing colon at t/notcontiguous.t line 66

0.16  Sun Jun 25 16:13:00 PDT 2006
	fixed ->new() issues with long digit strings ->new('::fffff')
	and non hex digits ->new('::foo').

	for spotting those bugs

0.15  Tue Jun 13 14:42:34 PDT 2006
	UtilPP.pm v0.07 & Util.xs 'shiftleft' so that the original
	argument is returned when the shift count is '0' or missing

0.14  Tue Jun  6 08:37:01 PDT 2006
	add logic to check LIBS => [-lfiles]
	individually. ExtUtils::xxx does a bad job and
	leaves libs that do not exist in the list
	which causes 'siteconf' to blow up on missing libs
	on perl 5.053 (and probably others)

0.13  Tue Jun  6 08:33:11 PDT 2006
	added to xs file, 'hopefully' to allow build on windoze platforms

0.12  Tue Jun  6 08:21:12 PDT 2006
	add logic to makefile so 'siteconfig' and C libs
	are not used in PurePerl mode

0.11  Mon Jun  5 14:45:09 PDT 2006
	fix Sparc problems
    1)	add workaround for OS's that do not have inet_aton

	#if MACRO1 == MACRO2

0.10  Sat Jun  3 19:07:51 PDT 2006
	add site configuration to supply u_intxx_t vars
	for Sun OS and others that don't have them

0.09  Sun May  7 18:06:43 PDT 2006

	to speed up ipv4->6, ipv6->4 conversions

0.08  Wed Apr 26 18:33:12 PDT 2006
	correct documentation error
	add ipv6to4

0.07  Sun Apr 23 16:11:56 PDT 2006
	correct reporting error in UtilPP v0.04 for
	incorrect argument length in ipv4 -> 6 conversions

	add conditional netaddr conversion functions
	ipanyto6, maskanyto6 to Util.xs and UtilPP v0.05

0.06  Tue Apr 18 16:50:53 PDT 2006
	add ipv4to6, mask4to6 to Util.pm and UtilPP.pm v0.03

0.05  Sat Apr 15 15:48:17 PDT 2006

	failed to update README during build

0.04  Wed Apr 12 15:43:33 PDT 2006
	add Util_IS.pm to guarantee that the XS lib is not
	loaded if a previous incarnation of the same version
	has previously been installed on the system and the
	module is built with -noxs

	update minisocket to perl-5.9.3, add header
	file for backwards compatibility

	and check for spurious bits in the network mask
