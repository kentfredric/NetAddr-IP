0.17  Thu Jul  6 10:46:48 PDT 2006
	update 'siteconf line 1608' to fix empty variable in inet_aton test
	update 'siteconf line 1636' to fix empty variable in inet_pton test
	add missing colon at t/notcontiguous.t line 66

0.16  Sun Jun 25 16:13:00 PDT 2006
	fixed ->new() issues with long digit strings ->new('::fffff')
	and non hex digits ->new('::foo'). 
	Thanks to Radoslaw Zielinski <radek42@gmail.com>
	for spotting those bugs

0.15  Tue Jun 13 14:42:34 PDT 2006
	UtilPP.pm v0.07 & Util.xs 'shiftleft' so that the orignal

0.14  Tue Jun  6 08:37:01 PDT 2006
	add logic to check LIBS => [-lfiles]
	individually. ExtUtils::xxx does a bad job and
	leaves libs that do not exist in the list
	which causes 'siteconf' to blow up on missing libs
	on perl 5.053 (and probably others)

0.13  Tue Jun  6 08:33:11 PDT 2006
	added to xs file, 'hopefully' to allow build on windoze platforms

	add logic to makefile so 'siteconfig' and C libs
	are not used in PurePerl mode

0.11  Mon Jun  5 14:45:09 PDT 2006
	fix Sparc problems
    1)	add workaround for OS's that do not have inet_aton

	#if MACRO1 == MACRO2

0.10  Sat Jun  3 19:07:51 PDT 2006
	add site configuration to supply u_intxx_t vars
	for Sun OS and others that don't have them

0.09  Sun May  7 18:06:43 PDT 2006

0.05  Sat Apr 15 15:48:17 PDT 2006

0.04  Wed Apr 12 15:43:33 PDT 2006
	add Util_IS.pm to guarantee that the XS lib is not 
	loaded if a previous incarnation of the same version
	has previously been installed on the system and the
	module is built with -noxs
