Revision history for Perl extension NetAddr::IP::Lite

1.22  Tue Nov 16 16:28:37 PST 2010
	update new6 to properly classify short ipv4 notation
	i.e. 127/8 with test for ":" rather than match for \d.\d.\d.\d
	
	thanks to Steve Huff (SHUFF) * shuff@cpan.org for 
	spotting that bug.

	update t/v4-new.t for deprecated array syntax in perl 5.13
	was:	qw(...stuff...)
	is:	(qw(...stuff...))

	thanks to Todd Rinaldo <toddr@cpan.org> for reporting this

1.21  Thu Oct 28 14:26:19 PDT 2010
	fix bug where new6 improperly assigns the mask value 
	for and ipv4 address in 32 bit space instead of 128 bit space

	Thanks to Mark Martinec and Steve Huff (SHUFF) * shuff@cpan.org
	for spotting and replicating that bug

	added new_cis and new_cis6 to Lite.pm v1.21 to accomodate
	Cisco syntax that has IP and MASK seperated by a space.

	Updated typo in documentation that left out example
	print new6 stuff

1.20  Mon Oct 25 16:22:01 PDT 2010
	Updated _xnew to properly handle ipV6 notation of the form
	xxxx:xxxx:xxxx:xxxx:xxxx:xxxx, DDD

	Thanks to Dusty Mabe <Dusty.Mabe@tekelec.com> for spotting this bug

1.19  Wed Sep 29 10:32:50 PDT 2010
	Conditionalize import of AF_INET6 in Util.pm
	NetAddr::IP::UtilPolluted

1.18  Wed Sep 22 13:39:08 PDT 2010
	Added overload => 'ne' and '!=' to Lite.pm

1.17  Tue Sep 21 17:50:50 PDT 2010
	Pull Socket6 stuff out of Lite and put into
	NetAddr::IP::Util.pm in its own namespace

1.16  Wed Aug 11 12:45:49 PDT 2010
	When using Socket6, pull in missing symbol PF_INET6, which may
	or may not be present, from Socket.

1.15  Tue Jul 20 15:32:23 PDT 2010
	Resolve named hosts using gethostbyname, followed by gethostbyname6
	to determine whether to set ipV6 flag

	Thanks to Dusty Mabe <Dusty.Mabe@tekelec.com> for spotting this bug

1.14  Thu Jul  8 18:17:38 PDT 2010
	added support for the sub "new" to resolve host6 names
	if the OPTIONAL perl Socket6 module is available

1.13  Tue Dec  9 16:00:35 PST 2008
	added missing regexp to classify arguments as BCD numbers,
	apparently this has been missing from NetAddr::IP::Lite 
	since the first release. 
	Thanks to Carlos Vicente cvicente@cpan.org for reporting this bug.

	revised UtilPP v1.7 to work around perl 5.8.4
	failures with certain @_ operations of goto &sub...
	see perl bug [ 23429]. Unfortunately, perl-5.8.4 is
	the distribution of choice for many solaris boxes

1.12  Sun Nov 23 19:32:59 PST 2008
	repaired missing sub Zeros

	added minus (-) overloading to allow the subtraction
	of two NetAddr::IP objects to get the difference between
	the object->{addr}'s as a numeric value
	Thanks to Rob Riepel <riepel@networking.Stanford.EDU>
	for the initial code and inspiration for this enhancement

1.11  Sat Nov  1 15:13:48 PST 2008
	add test for characters not allowed by rfc952 before
	the call to gethostbyname in sub new() for those people
	that insist on using deprecated functionality :aton
	and OS's that fail to notice calls to gethostbyname
	with binary arguments

1.10  Wed Oct 22 14:54:12 PDT 2008
	add new no octal method for improperly formatted ipV4 addresses

	In Util.pm v1.22, eliminated dependence on PL_sawampersand
	thanks to Mark Martinec <Mark.Martinec@ijs.si>
	for spotting this and submitting a patch.

	In Util.pm v1.22, force -noxs mode for Win32

	In Util.pm v1.22, use autoconf to configure 'C' build

1.09  Thu Oct 16 19:35:33 PDT 2008
	again... clear build bug for Win32 in Util.pm v 1.21

1.08  Sat Sep 27 12:27:28 PDT 2008
    in Util v0.19
	updated test for ENDIANess in siteconf

	add test in inet_aton to detect overange IP dot quad values
	missed by some broken Socket implementations
	i.e. 256.1.1.1

1.07  Tue Sep  2 19:09:57 PDT 2008
	in the off chance that NetAddr::IP::Lite objects are created
	and the caller later loads NetAddr::IP and expects to use
	those objects, let the AUTOLOAD routine find and redirect
	NetAddr::IP::Lite method and subroutine calls to NetAddr::IP.

	updated t/v4-wnew.t so that non-existent
	domains are "really" not there

1.06  Sat Jun  7 12:57:18 PDT 2008
	add method "new_from_aton" and related documentation

	comparisons of the form <, >, <=, >=
		10.0.0.0/24 {operator} 10.0.0.0/16
	return now return the comparison of the cidr value
	when the address portion is equal.
NOTE:	this comparison returns the comparison of the NUMERIC
	value of the CIDR. This produces the counter intuitive result
	that /24 > /16. There is logic to this, really! For proper
	operation of commands like "Compact" and "Coalesce", lists of
	netaddr objects must sort in ascending order. However, this
	conflicts with the requirement for larger netblocks to sort
	FIRST so as to include smaller ones. This logic extends to
	any requirement for a sort of netaddr objects. It should be
	further noted that the mixing of netaddr objects with varying
	IP addresses and CIDR allocations can lead to unexpected
	results since the comparisons done first on the IP portion
	and then on the CIDR portion. The documentation has been
	updated appropriately.
	Thanks to Peter DeVries for spotting this discrepancy
