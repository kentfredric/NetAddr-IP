Revision history for Perl extension NetAddr::IP::Lite

1.09  Thu Oct 16 19:35:33 PDT 2008
        again... clear build bug for Win32 in Util.pm v 1.21
	
1.08  Sat Sep 27 12:27:28 PDT 2008
    in Util v0.19
	updated test for ENDIANess in siteconf
	
        add test in inet_aton to detect overange IP dot quad values
        missed by some broken Socket implementations
        i.e. 256.1.1.1

1.07  Tue Sep  2 19:09:57 PDT 2008
	in the off chance that NetAddr::IP::Lite objects are created
	and the caller later loads NetAddr::IP and expects to use   
	those objects, let the AUTOLOAD routine find and redirect   
	NetAddr::IP::Lite method and subroutine calles to NetAddr::IP.

	updated t/v4-wnew.t so that non-existent 
	domains are "really" not there

1.06  Sat Jun  7 12:57:18 PDT 2008
	add method "new_from_aton" and related documentation

	comparisons of the form <, >, <=, >=  
		10.0.0.0/24 {operator} 10.0.0.0/16
	return now return the comparision of the cidr value
	when the address portion is equal. 
NOTE:	this comparison returns the comparison of the NUMERIC
	value of the CIDR. This produces the counter intuitive result
	that /24 > /16. There is logic to this, really! For proper
	operation of commands like "Compact" and "Coalesce", lists of
	netaddr objects must sort in ascending order. However, this
	conflicts with the requirement for larger netblocks to sort
	FIRST so as to include smaller ones. This logic extends to 
	any requirement for a sort of netaddr objects. It should be
	further noted that the mixing of netaddr objects with varying 
	IP addresses and CIDR allocations can lead to unexpected 
	results since the comparisons done first on the IP portion
	and then on the CIDR portion. The documentation has been
	updated appropriately.
	Thanks to Peter DeVries for spotting this discrepancy
