Looks like this host does not have Test::Pod installed. Without this module,
the Pod documentation cannot be tested. This is not a big deal really, but
you might want to install Test::Mod by issuing the following command:

    perl -MCPAN -e "install('Test::Pod')"

at a nearby shell. This is nice because it allows easy tests of your own
documentation.

$checker = 0;

eval q{ use Pod::Coverage;
	$checker = 1; };

unless ($checker)
{
    print <<EOF;

You might want to install Pod::Coverage, so that coverage of the
documentation can be properly tested. You can do so by typing the
following:

    perl -MCPAN -e "install('Pod::Coverage')"

EOF
    ;
}

print <<EOF;

W A R N I N G - Please do read below if you have legacy code
======================================================================

Versions 3.21 and above of NetAddr::IP, include hooks for the Storable
class that are incompatible with the old (automatic) method of storing
data. To regain backwards compatibility, the module must be use()d as

    use NetAddr::IP ':old_storable';

Which will disable the new hooks and revert back to the old ways.

If you do  not use Storable along NetAddr::IP or  just don't know what
this all means, most likely you're safe to go along.

Versions before 3.25 recognized by default IP addresses as returned by
inet_aton. This is no longer the default. To enable this behaviour
again, the module must be use()d as

    use NetAddr::IP ':aton';

We're still open for feedback on this one...
