Revision history for Perl extension NetAddr::IP

4.013  Wed Oct 22 15:04:49 PDT 2008
	In Lite.pm v1.10, add new no octal method for 
	improperly formatted ipV4 addresses

	In Util.pm v1.22, eliminated dependance on PL_sawampersand
	thanks to Mark Martinec <Mark.Martinec@ijs.si>
	for spotting this and submitting a patch.

	In Util.pm v1.22, force -noxs mode for Win32

	In Util.pm v1.22, use autoconf to configure 'C' build

4.012  Thu Oct 16 19:35:33 PDT 2008
	clear build bug for Win32 in Util.pm v 1.21

4.011  released Oct 6 13:10

4.010  Sat Sep 27 17:00:28 PDT 2008
    in NetAddr::IP::Util v0.19
	updated test for ENDIANess in siteconf

	add test in inet_aton to detect overange IP dot quad values
	missed by some broken Socket implementations
	i.e. 256.1.1.1 would fail to return undef

NOTE: 	Versions 4.008 and 4.009 had limited release to tester only
	and were not uploaded to CPAN. All of the v4.008, 4.009
	changes are incorporated in v4.010

4.009  Tue Sep  2 19:09:57 PDT 2008
	In NetAddr::IP::Lite v1.07,
	in the off chance that NetAddr::IP::Lite objects are created
	and the caller later loads NetAddr::IP and expects to use   
	those objects, let the AUTOLOAD routine find and redirect   
	NetAddr::IP::Lite method and subroutine calles to NetAddr::IP.

	updated Lite/t/v4-wnew.t so that non-existent 
	domains are "really" not there

4.008  Sat Jun  7 14:01:55 PDT 2008
	inherit method "new_from_aton" from NetAddr::IP::Lite
	add related documentation

      Inherited methods from Lite.pm updated as follows:
	
	comparisons of the form <, >, <=, >=  
		10.0.0.0/24 {operator} 10.0.0.0/16
	return now return the comparision of the cidr value
	when the address portion is equal. 
NOTE:	this comparison returns the comparison of the NUMERIC
	value of the CIDR. This produces the counter intuitive result
	that /24 > /16. There is logic to this, really! For proper
	operation of commands like "Compact" and "Coalesce", lists of
	netaddr objects must sort in ascending order. However, this
	conflicts with the requirement for larger netblocks to sort
	FIRST so as to include smaller ones. This logic extends to 
	any requirement for a sort of netaddr objects. It should be
	further noted that the mixing of netaddr objects with varying 
	IP addresses and CIDR allocations can lead to unexpected 
	results since the comparisons done first on the IP portion
	and then on the CIDR portion. The documentation has been
	updated appropriately.
	Thanks to Peter DeVries for spotting this discrepancy
