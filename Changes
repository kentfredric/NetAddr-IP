Revision history for Perl extension IP::Address.

0.01  Sun Jul 11 13:26:27 1999
	- original  version;  Basic testing  and  release  to CPAN  as
	  version 0.01. This is considered beta software.

0.02  Mon Jul 12
	- Multiple changes  to fix endiannes issues. This  code is now
	  moderately tested on Wintel and Sun/Solaris boxes.

0.03  Wed Jul 14

1.00  Wed Dec 05 2000
	- Implemented ->new_subnet. Version changed to 1.00.
	- less croak()ing when improper input  is fed to the module. A
	  more consistent 'undef' is returned now instead to allow the
	  user to better handle the error.
	- Released

1.10  Wed May 02 2000
	- As  per  MARNIX   A.   VAN  AMMERS  [mav6@ns02.comp.pge.com]
	  suggestion, changed  the syntax of the loop  in host_enum to
	  be the same of the enum method.
	- Fixed the MS-DOS ^M  at the end-of-line problem. This should
	  make the module easier to use for *nix users.
	- Released

1.20  Sun Jun 25 2000
	- Implemented ->compact and ->expand methods.
	- Applying for official name
	- Released

1.21  Mon Jun 26 2000
	- Added  ->addr_number and  ->mask_bits.  Currently  we return
	  normal  numbers (not  BigInts).   Please test  this in  your
	  platform and report any problems!

2.00  Wed Jun 28 2000
	- Released under the new *official* name of NetAddr::IP

2.10  Thu Oct 12 2000
	- Added support for ->new($min, $max, $bits) form
	- Added ->to_numeric. This helps serializing objects

2.20  Mon Jan  1 2001
	- Chris Dowling  reported that  the sort method  introduced in
	  v1.20  for ->expand  and ->compact  doesn't always  return a
	  number under perl versions < 5.6.0.  His fix was applied and
	  redistributed.  Thanks Chris!
	- This module is hopefully released with no CR-LF issues!
	- Fixed a warning about uninitialized values during make test

2.21  Thu Feb  8 2001
	- Dennis  Boylan pointed  out a  bug under  Linux  and perhaps
	  other platforms  as well causing the  error "Sort subroutine
	  didn't         return         single        value         at
	  /usr/lib/perl5/site_perl/5.6.0/NetAddr/IP.pm  line  299,  <>
	  line 2." or similar. This was fixed.

2.22  Wed Mar 28 2001
	- Some changes  suggested by Jeroen Ruigrok  and Anton Berezin
	  were included. Thanks guys!

2.23  Tue Aug 14 2001
	- Bug fix for /XXX.XXX.XXX.XXX netmasks under v5.6.1 suggested
	  by Tim Wuyts. Thanks!
	- Tested the module under MACHTYPE=hppa1.0-hp-hpux11.00. It is
          now  konwn to  work  under Linux  (Intel/AMD), Digital  Unix
          (Alpha),   Solaris  (Sun),  HP-UX11   (HP-PA-RISC),  Windows
          9x/NT/2K (using ActiveState on Intel).

2.24  Sat Aug 25 2001
	- A spurious  warning when  expand()ing with -w  under certain
	  circumstances  was removed. This  involved using  /31s, /32s
	  and the same netmask as the input.  Thanks to Elie Rosenblum
	  for pointing it out.
	- Slight change  in license terms to ease  redistribution as a
          Debian package.
