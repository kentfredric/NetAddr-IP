NAME
    NetAddr::IP - Manages IPv4 addresses and subnets

This module provides a simple interface to manipulate IP addresses as
objects. Among the operations that can be done are comparison, tests
for addresses within subnets, enumeration, splitting, summarization
and others.

NetAddr::IP objects also "stringify" themselves automatically to
unclutter I/O functions.

To install, follow the traditional incantations:

perl Makefile.PL
make
make test
make install

This module has been tested under many platforms, using perl 5.6.0 or
newer.
