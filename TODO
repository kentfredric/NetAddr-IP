o More tests for IPv6 functionality. This should be thoroughly tested.

o Extend the formats accepted for v6 addresses.

o Add support for other notations (when found).

o Add a way to force the recognition of a v6 IP address when the input
  is presented numerically. (Suggested by Carlos Vicente)

o As suggested by Geoff Seeley's application, it may be good to have a
  method that will convert an arbitrary IP range into a list of
  subnets (a list of NetAddr::IP objects)

o Add simple is_broadcast and is_network utility functions

o Have foreach iteration of NetAddr::IP return objects based in the
  specified netmask instead of forcing /32s, as suggested by Steve
  Thompson
